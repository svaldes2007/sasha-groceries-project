1. I created an additional method called public String removeMostExpensive(). It removes the most expensive item in a family’s grocery list and returns its name. 
This helps the user lower the cost of their grocery bill if it’s over their budget by removing the fewest items possible. It works by iterating through the map 
which is returned by getGroceryMap() to identify the most expensive item. This is accomplished by comparing temporary variables representing the item’s name and 
price to each other during each iteration. The name of the most expensive item is saved to a String variable and then later returned. Then, it iterates through 
the GroceryList to and increments a local variable called index to find the index of the most expensive item in the list. Once the index is identified, the method 
public void remove(int idx) is called to remove the most expensive item from the list. 

2. Currently, the program does not have a user interface which makes it difficult to use for people who don’t know how to code in java. All of the feedback that 
the user gets is in the terminal which is not very aesthetically pleasing. I would improve this aspect of the program by creating a user interface using JavaScript 
React so that I could create aesthetic graphics and a clear and simple interactive user interface.
